<!--Let's include some notes: Meteor's templating system is called 'Spacebars'
Spacebars is HTML with the addition of three things:
1. 'inclusions': use {{> templateName}} syntax and simply tell Meteor to replace the
inclusion with the template of the same name
2. 'Expressions': such as {{title}} either call a property of the current object or 
return the value of a template helper as defined in the current template's manager
3. 'blick helpers' are special tags that control the flow of the template such as 
{{#each}}...{{/each}} or {{#if}}...{{/if}}. -->

<head>
    <title>Microscope</title>
</head>
